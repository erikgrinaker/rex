# Rex

Rex is a simple regular expression engine, written for fun. It targets [POSIX Extended Regular Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended) syntax.

Thanks to [Alex Grebenyuk](https://kean.blog/about/) for his great article series [Let's Build a Regex Engine](https://kean.blog/post/lets-build-regex), which was the inspiration for this project.
